It is compatible with Spark MLlib and leverages open source Intel\u00ae oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) to provide highly optimized algorithms and get most out of CPU and GPU capabilities. It also take advantage of open source Intel\u00ae oneAPI Collective Communications Library (oneCCL) to provide efficient communication patterns in multi-node multi-GPU clusters. Compatibility OAP MLlib tried to maintain the same API interfaces and produce same results that are identical with Spark MLlib. However due to the nature of float point operations, there may be some small deviation from the original result, we will try our best to make sure the error is within acceptable range. For those algorithms that are not accelerated by OAP MLlib, the original Spark MLlib one will be used. Getting Started Java/Scala Users Preferred Use a pre-built OAP MLlib JAR to get started. You can firstly download OAP package from OAP-JARs-Tarball and extract this Tarball to get oap-mllib-x.x.x-with-spark-x.x.x.jar under oap-1.0.0-bin-spark-3.0.0/jars . Then you can refer to the following Running section to try out. Python/PySpark Users Preferred Use a pre-built JAR to get started. If you have finished OAP-Installation-Guide , you can find compiled OAP MLlib JAR oap-mllib-x.x.x-with-spark-x.x.x.jar in $HOME/miniconda2/envs/oapenv/oap_jars/ . Then you can refer to the following Running section to try out. Building From Scratch You can also build the package from source code, please refer to Building section. Running Prerequisites CentOS 7.0+, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS+ Java JRE 8.0+ Runtime Apache Spark 3.0.0+ Generally, our common system requirements are the same with Intel\u00ae oneAPI Toolkit, please refer to here for details. Intel\u00ae oneAPI Toolkits components used by the project are already included into JAR package mentioned above. There are no extra installations for cluster nodes. Spark Configuration Users usually run Spark application on YARN with client mode. In that case, you only need to add the following configurations in spark-defaults.conf or in spark-submit command line before running. # absolute path of the jar for uploading spark.files /path/to/oap-mllib-x.x.x-with-spark-x.x.x.jar # absolute path of the jar for driver class path spark.driver.extraClassPath /path/to/oap-mllib-x.x.x-with-spark-x.x.x.jar # relative path to spark.files, just specify jar name in current dir spark.executor.extraClassPath ./oap-mllib-x.x.x-with-spark-x.x.x.jar Sanity Check To use K-means example for sanity check, you need to upload a data file to your HDFS and change related variables in run.sh of kmeans example. Then run the following commands: $ cd OAP/oap-mllib/examples/kmeans $ ./build.sh $ ./run.sh Benchmark with HiBench Use Hibench to generate dataset with various profiles, and change related variables in run-XXX.sh script when applicable. Then run the following commands: $ cd OAP/oap-mllib/examples/kmeans-hibench $ ./build.sh $ ./run-hibench-oap-mllib.sh PySpark Support As PySpark-based applications call their Scala couterparts, they shall be supported out-of-box. An example can be found in the Examples section. Building Prerequisites We use Apache Maven to manage and build source code. The following tools and libraries are also needed to build OAP MLlib: JDK 8.0+ Apache Maven 3.6.2+ GNU GCC 4.8.5+ Intel\u00ae oneAPI Toolkits 2021.1.1 Components: Data Analytics Library (oneDAL) Threading Building Blocks (oneTBB) Open Source Intel\u00ae oneAPI Collective Communications Library (oneCCL) Intel\u00ae oneAPI Toolkits and its components can be downloaded and install from here . Installation process for oneAPI using Package Managers (YUM (DNF), APT, and ZYPPER) is also available. Generally you only need to install oneAPI Base Toolkit for Linux with all or selected components mentioned above. Instead of using oneCCL included in Intel\u00ae oneAPI Toolkits, we prefer to build from open source oneCCL to resolve some bugs. More details about oneAPI can be found here . You can also refer to this script and comments in it to install correct oneAPI version and manually setup the environments. Scala and Java dependency descriptions are already included in Maven POM file. Build Building oneCCL To clone and build from open source oneCCL, run the following commands: $ git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneCCL $ cd oneCCL $ git checkout beta08 $ mkdir build && cd build $ cmake .. $ make -j install The generated files will be placed in /your/oneCCL_source_code/build/_install Building OAP MLlib To clone and checkout source code, run the following commands: $ git clone https://github.com/Intel-bigdata/OAP Optional to checkout specific release branch: $ git checkout -b branch-1.0-spark-3.x origin/branch-1.0-spark-3.x We rely on environment variables to find required toolchains and libraries. Please make sure the following environment variables are set for building: Environment Description JAVA_HOME Path to JDK home directory DAALROOT Path to oneDAL home directory TBB_ROOT Path to oneTBB home directory CCL_ROOT Path to oneCCL home directory We suggest you to source setvars.sh script into current shell to setup building environments as following: $ source /opt/intel/inteloneapi/setvars.sh $ source /your/oneCCL_source_code/build/_install/env/setvars.sh Be noticed we are using our own built oneCCL instead, we should source oneCCL's setvars.sh to overwrite oneAPI one. If you prefer to buid your own open source oneDAL , oneTBB versions rather than use the ones included in oneAPI TookKits, you can refer to the related build instructions and manually source setvars.sh accordingly. To build, run the following commands: $ cd OAP/oap-mllib/mllib-dal $ ./build.sh The built JAR package will be placed in target directory with the name oap-mllib-x.x.x-with-spark-x.x.x.jar .
